// Expressions and Operators

//Addition Operators (+) or String Concatenation Operator, using the plus symbol.
// The Assignment Operator (=), the equal symbol.
// *Operands* are "identifiers" , a"variable name".
// *Functions* are another type of "Operand".
// Programmers give  *Operands* their names, they are not 'fixed' like keywords and operators.
// By combining *Operands* and *Operators* , we create "expressions", then used to compose statements.

//a;
// JavaScript compliler won't know what to do with this, its not a "Variable".
// Neither are we asking to create a "new Variable".
// Theres nothing inside of "a".

// Must use types of xpresions in a high level.
//let a
// With just these two, we have an "Operator" and an "Operand"
//let = "operator"
//a = "operand"
// This is one type of expression

// Type Of Expressions:
//----------------------------
// Variable Declaration
//let a;
//Assign a Value
//a = 4;
//Performs an evaluation that returns a "value".
//_______________________
//let b = 3;
let c = 2;
//b + c
//________________
//_______________________
//Three expressions in here...can you find them?
//let a = b + c;
//1. "let a"...Variable declaration
//2. Perform an evaluation "b + c" 
//3. result assigned to "a"

//Categories of Operators:-
//Assignment (=)
//Arithmetic (+,-,*,/,%) (+Addition), (-Subtraction), (*Multiplication), (/Division), (%Modulus).

//Increment/Decrement ++, --    Increments value by one./ Decrements value by one.
//_____________________________
var a = 1;
a++;
//console.log(a);
//The answer is"2".
//console.log(a++);
console.log(a);

//The answer is 2, 3
console.log(++a);
//___________________________

//The Modulus gives us the remainder amount
//_______________________________
var m = 10 % 3;
console.log(m);
//The answer is "1"
//______________________________
// string " + ...will  string concatenation operator that will take 2 strings and allow them to be appended together
//to create one new string.

//Precedence
var b = (1 + 2) * 3;
console.log(b);
//The answer is 3.


//Function invocation operators
console.log('');


//Logical and : && or: || (When i want to add 2 things together and evaluate whether they need to be true or not).

//"Member Accessor Operator">>>>> the dot period (.)
console.log
// Allows us to access members the log function  of the console object inside of javaScript.

//"Code Block Operators">>>>>>> { }

//"Array element Access Operators">>>>>> [ ]
