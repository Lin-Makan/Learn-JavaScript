//Naming variables
//When naming double name variables, first letter is lowercase, second letter is uppercase
let firstNumber = 7;
let secondNumber = 3;
let firstName = 'Lindo Makan';
let zipCode = '75082';
console.log(zipCode);

//The first use of double words must be a lowercase and and the second must be highercase.
let firstZipCode = '75082';
let ssecondZipCode = '60459';
console.log(firstZipCode);
//An error will occur if you use the same variable to assign a different value to it
